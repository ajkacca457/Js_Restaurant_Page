> This is a Microverse javascript project which creates a dynamic restaurant website.The requirement of this project was to build a Restaurant Page. This project was designed for practicing DOM manipulation by dynamically rendering a simple restaurant homepage! Only javascript was used to render all the website content. All the content of different page was created by javascript and it doesn't need any kind of browser reload to render other pages.
